## Upcoming updates

#### Additional props for `Quiz`: `className?`, `styles?`

Each receives an object that allows modification of 3 types within the quiz.

```ts
type className = {
  container: string;
  question: string;
  options: string;
}


type styles = {
  container: React.CSSProperties;
  question: React.CSSProperties;
  options: React.CSSProperties;
}
```

Examples of customization e.g. options are displayed in a straight column rather than 2x2.

#### New quiz format
```ts
"multiple-answers" | "categorical" | "mixed" 

// "multiple-answers": more than one possible correct answer
// "categorical" (personality tests): no correct answer; each option corresponds to a category and adds to a group-based score
// "mixed": each question can be of any format
```

#### Templates (starter-kit) 

Create a `true-false` quiz using `single-answer` format

## Further down the road
- Callback function prop that accepts hook to allow retrieving of data (currentScore, results) from Quiz.
- Analysis report in results page, and custom results page.
- Support mixed types in question and options, e.g. an image as question or a mix of image and text as options.
